<h1>CHEM 12A - Organic Chemistry (5 Units)</h1>
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Chemistry 12A is the first of the two classes in the canonical organic chemistry series that
is offered at the undergraduate level. This class is the College of Chemistry equivalent of
Chemistry 3A, which is a class traditionally taken by MCB and other health-related majors.
This class is more thorough and more difficult than the 3A/3B series, and there is a larger
emphasis on multistep syntheses and arrow-pushing mechanisms. The class size of the 12
series is significantly smaller than the 3 series; most students in 12A will also be College of
Chemistry majors.</p>
<p>Chemistry 12A teaches the fundamentals of organic structure, investigates the main four
organic elementary steps, and finishes with some basic organic reactions and a discussion
of aromaticity. Each week, there is a 5-hour lab that teaches techniques frequently used in
the real organic laboratory setting. There is a strong emphasis on characterization methods
in the lab section, especially with NMR. NMR will be taught from the beginning; no prior
knowledge is necessary.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>CHEM 1B, 4B, 15 (or equivalent) with grade of C- or higher</p>
<p>Course is only offered in the fall</p>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Orbitals, bonding and structure</li>
	<li>Conformational Analysis, stereochemistry</li>
	<li>Substitution and elimination reactions: SN2, SN1, E2, E1</li>
	<li>Electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes and alkynes</li>
	<li>Aromaticity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laboratory Topics Covered</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chromatography: Thin Layer Chromatography and Column Chromatography</li>
	<li>Recrystallization</li>
	<li>High Pressure/Performance Liquid Chromatography</li>
	<li>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workload</h2>
<h3>Coursework</h3>
<ul>
	<li>3 midterms</li>
	<li>1 final exam based on lecture material (finals week)</li>
	<li> 1 final exam based on laboratory material (last lab lecture session)</li>
	<li>9 problem sets</li>
	<li>16-20 online pre-lecture problem sets</li>
	<li>10 lab reports (due at the end of the lab session)</li>
	<li>1 formal lab report</li>
	<li>3 lab lecture quizzes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time Commitment</h3>
<p>4 hours of lecture per week (including 1 hour for lab lecture), 5 hours of lab section per week, up to 15 hours of homework per week.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Course</h2>
<h3>When to take</h3>
<p>This class is required for College of Chemistry majors. <b>It is fall-only.</b> Organic chemistry traditionally is the next step after general chemistry. Take it in fall of your sophomore year. This class is very time-intensive, so plan your semester accordingly.</p>
<h3>What Next?</h3>
<ul>

	<li><a href="chem135.html">CHEM 135: Chemical Biology</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Comments and Tips</h2>
<p>This class does not need any prior organic chemistry knowledge, everything is taught from the very basics, including lab concepts.</p>
<p>Rather than following a somewhat traditional path of memorization in organic chemistry, this course <i>heavily favors a fundamental conceptual understanding</i> via orbital interactions and arrow pushing HOMO->LUMO mechanisms. You can do well in the class without memorizing very much. The goal of the class is to rationalize how reactions you’ve haven’t seen before, will work, based on the fundamental steps you’ve seen covered in lecture.</p>
<p>The weekly lab reports are finished in the lab period, you don’t do them at home.</p>
<p>Attendance is often indirectly taken at lectures through in-class worksheets.</p>
<p>The time commitment for this class is high, but you will come out of the class feeling confident with the skill base that you’ve acquired. This class is unusual because it stresses understanding of the most basic concepts, rather than memorization.</p>
<p>CHEM 12B focuses on organic synthesis, and uses some background from 12A.</p>
