<h1>FAQ For Incoming First Years</h1>
<p>Please note that this is general guide. If you are looking for more specific advice (for your particular situation), please talk to your advisor.</p>
<button class="accordion"><h3>Should I take CHEM 1A or CHEM 4A?</h3></button>
<div class="panel"><p>It depends on your high school chemistry background. If you did not have the opportunity to take AP Chemistry, or if you feel like your AP Chemistry education was weak, it is advisable to take CHEM 1A. If you have taken AP Chemistry in high school, you should take CHEM 4A.</p>
<p>In terms of workload and topics covered, both classes are surprisingly pretty similar. The main difference is that CHEM 1A does not assume any past knowledge from AP Chemistry, smoothing out the learning curve in your first semester.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><h3>There seems to be a lot of honor classes/classes with different difficulties (MATH 1A vs. MATH 10A, MATH 53 vs. MATH H53, PHYS 7A vs. PHYS 8A vs. PHYS 5A, etc.) Which one should I take?</h3></button>
<div class="panel"><p>College of Chemistry students typically take the MATH 1 series, and Chemistry and Chemical Engineering majors typically take the PHYS 7 series, while Chemical Biology majors typically take the PHYS 8 series. </p>
<p>With that being said, Chemistry and Chemical Biology majors are allowed to take the MATH 10 instead of the MATH 1 series, which covers calculus (like the MATH 1 series) and includes probability and combinatorics. This course is generally intended for those in the life sciences, and will be most helpful for students who are interested in being pre-health. They are also allowed to substitue PHYS 89 for MATH 54. PHYS 89 covers many of the topics seen in MATH 54 (and some even in MATH 53), but with a focus on how they apply to the physical sciences. The depth of material covered is generally the same for both classes, with the main difference being the applied/theoretical relevancy.</p>
<p>The honors series in the math department is not aimed for math majors (for example, math majors can choose to take MATH 53 and still declare), but for those who are interested in a deeper and more rigorous introduction ot the material. This usually involves a large focus on proofs and difficult problems. If you choose to take one of these courses, it will count for the non-honors equilavent course (for example, if you take MATH 54, it will count towards your MATH 54 requirement). That being said, taking an honors class is not necessary to the completion of your degree, nor will it necessarily give you an upper hand in later classes for the Chemistry, Chemical Biology, and Chemical Engineering majors. You should only take the class if you are interested in a deeper look at the material.</p>
<p>The PHYS 5 series is aimed for physics majors, and is generally extremely math and theory heavy. Like with honors math classes, taking the PHYS 5 series is not necessary for the completion of any CoC majors, and will not necessarily give you an upper hand in later courses. That being said, if you are interested in a deeper look at the material in physics, you should feel free to take the course. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that, for physics, you can freely switch between different series. For example, if you start with PHYS 8A but feel like you want to learn more physics, you are free to take PHYS 7B the following semester. Similarly, if you take PHYS 5A but feel like you don't want to continue taking the 5 series, you can switch to PHYS 7B in the following semester.</p>
<p>If you would like to substitute courses other than those that are previously approved, please talk to your college advisor before doing so.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h3>How do I prepare for CHEM 1A/4A in the summer?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>First, if you've been admitted to Berkeley, you should congratulate yourself and take a break in the summer! While the introductory chemistry classes may be difficult, they do not require you to do any work before you start school. Please take the time before college starts to rest and relax instead.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><h3>I'm struggling in my chem/cheme classes. What do I do?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>There are many different resources that the College of Chemistry has to offer. Office Hours (with your Professor or GSI) are always helpful, and you are allowed to go to any OH for your class, even those not hosted by your GSI. If you feel like you need more personalized help for specific questions, the College of Chemistry offers FREE <a href="peertutoring.html">peer tutoring services</a> by highly capable students in Bixby Commons, Monday-Friday, 10 AM - 5 PM. If you feel like you need help with the course material itself, try utilizing <a href="chemscholars.html">the Chem-Scholars</a> program, provided that it is offered for your class. The Chem-Scholars program is available for units or without. </p>
<p>As a side note: it is not uncommon for CoC students to have done extremely well in high school before coming here and struggling, especially during their first few semesters. It takes some time to adjust to a new environment and different teaching styles. If you do feel like the change itself is overwhelming, do not hesitate to talk to your college advisors and utilize your free sessions at the Tang center.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Can I double major with a degree in the College of Chemistry? Is this a bad idea?</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Double majoring is not common in the College of Chemistry. That being said, it can be doable. Please visit the <a href="double.html">Double Major/Simultaneous Degree page</a> for some things you may want to consider.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h3>How do I minor while in the College of Chemistry?</h3></button>
<div class="panel"><p>Quite a few students in the College of Chemistry minor or seriously consider minoring in a different field. Please visit <a href="minor.html">Minoring in the College of Chemistry</a> for more information.</p>
